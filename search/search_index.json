Some, like common origin, can be a result of conscious and deliberate migration as a precursor to the others.</p> <p>The features above make a nation but do not confer any real material benefit on their own. It is the civilization that a nation assembles and the interactions within it that lead to the benefit. However, in our current state our nations are the only thing we have left as the associated civilizations were displaced and destroyed by Europeans ages ago.</p> <p>Without a civilization, a nation is rendered non-functional as it no longer has the capacity to function as a unit. Scattered within a new overarching civilization, common identity becomes largely ceremonial as all aspects of life are engaged with on an individual basis or only within the family unit. This constitutes a ceremonial nation.</p>"},{"location":"proposal/#ceremonial-nations","title":"Ceremonial Nations","text":"<p>Ceremonial nations are an example of what I call ceremonial kinship. Ceremonial kinship is the sort of kinship where relatives don't have any real familial interactions with each other until or unless there is a specific ceremony (ex. funeral) that needs to be attended.</p> <p>Although this is largely harmless between family members, at the national scale it renders members of the nation highly vulnerable. Whether it is socially, economically or politically, the members of such nations do not have much power to bargain or apply force with.</p> <p>In this state, nations become subject to the forces that control the overarching civilization, its institutions, and economic structures. These forces can be foreign nations (Europeans and their underlings) or political parties. The consequence of this is a general loss of national sovereignty which has some of the following outcomes among many:</p> <ul> <li>The deterioration and eventual extinction of the language of the nation due to disuse and exclusion from business, education and most common media. The language also stops being developed and expanded both in vocabulary and phrasal power making it necessary to continuously switch to foreign languages even where one wishes to use it.</li> <li>Statification (becoming static) of the nation's culture, values and attire as it falls out of general use and becomes itself ceremonial - only being used on special occasions (ex. Heritage day). This static culture, especially the attire, also becomes a sort of badge of authenticity that many prefer to keep static and will even reject modernized versions of the culture, halting progress.</li> <li>Loss of the ability to control the nation's way of life and destiny or secure the nation from external threats (rampant crime, global pandemics, climate change, etc.)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"proposal/#civilization","title":"Civilization","text":"<p>A civilization is a human society with its specific way of life that is defined by the organizational structures, familial groups, production, traditions and technology that the society has.</p> <p>In our current state, we are many ceremonial nations within a single European settler civilization. It (the settler civilization) is incorporated into a nation state (The Republic of South Africa) that I call \"the settler state\". I make a distinction between the land (the part of the surface of the planet that is within the borders of the state) and the country itself (the governmental structures and institutions).</p> <p>The way I see it, although the land may be ours the country itself is not. The country is merely a European country founded on our land. Our own unincorporated civilizations were destroyed long ago and I believe the proper course of action is to raise new civilizations to replace them. There are four main reasons why I want to create a new civilization:</p> <ul> <li>Post-Colonialism: I don't want to live in a post-colonial civilization; I want to live in our own civilization of just indigenous people.</li> <li>Dissent: Avoiding conflict with dissenters and being dragged along for their self-destructive exploits.</li> <li>Self-Determination: Expressing unrestrained self-determination, enabling us to control our way of life completely.</li> <li>Security: Gaining the ability to protect and preserve that way of life and ourselves from threats both man-made and environmental.</li> </ul> <p>Each reason is discussed in further detail below.</p>"},{"location":"proposal/#post-colonialism","title":"Post-Colonialism","text":"<p>The settler state is a post-colonial civilization.

Because we all want to have our way; cannot agree on a singular fate; and are all forced to share the same power structures, this creates unavoidable and insurmountable conflict. Thus, I believe the only way forward is to create a system of voluntary association through which those of us that see eye-to-eye can move forward together and avoid conflict with everyone else.</p>"},{"location":"proposal/#self-determination","title":"Self-Determination","text":"<p>Without the requirement of having to gain everyone's approval and support, any feature or goal that our group wants to manifest can be pursued immediately without all of the political power struggles that slow down progress.

Not allowing outside competition for businesses in our town or city while also exploiting the labour of outsiders that are not entitled to the same benefits as members of the nation).</li> <li>Centrally plan and fund valuable or otherwise desired industries.</li> </ul> <p>These are just a number of examples but the ultimate point is the following: we already have the power to create a way of life that suits us but the need to wrestle for and rend common power structures out of the hands of competitors creates a needless and perpetual barrier towards progress.</p>"},{"location":"proposal/#security","title":"Security","text":"<p>We exist in an unsafe and unstable country.

The new language will become the language of our nation and civilization. Upon its completion, all members will be required to learn and use it proficiently. Through subsequent usage and development in every domain, it will become refined enough to be used as the primary language in all realms of our society.</p> <p>The language will be formed through the structured merging of the pre-existing languages and the design of a new alphabet (that will not be based on the Latin alphabet).</p>"}]}
