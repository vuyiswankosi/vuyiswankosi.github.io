Introduction Humans organize themselves into groups in order to enhance group and individual fitness. This fitness is achieved through the group functioning as a single unit and commanding its combined might for the benefit of all members. Although these groupings can take on many forms, it is my opinion that the most effective grouping is that of the nation or tribe - but only where the nation is actually functional. Functional Nations Functional nations, within the scope of this discussion, are those that meet the following conditions: Members all have the same identity - this creates cohesion and singular loyalty. The nation has official leaders - this creates a single head and directional command for the group. The nation has formal power structures - this enables the nation to organize practically in the political, social and economic realms. Members live in the same place - this enables consolidation of power; erection of and access to common infrastructure; and physical security to be provided to all members in a practical way. The nation has an independent civilization - this enables members to create a desired way of life in a non-contentious way. Nations A nation is defined by one or more concepts that are held in common by members of the nation: Language Culture Religion or Spiritual Beliefs Geographical Origin Heritage These features normally appear organically as an aggregate consequence of the interactions between bodies of individuals over time. Some, like common origin, can be a result of conscious and deliberate migration as a precursor to the others. The features above make a nation but do not confer any real material benefit on their own. It is the civilization that a nation assembles and the interactions within it that lead to the benefit. However, in our current state our nations are the only thing we have left as the associated civilizations were displaced and destroyed by Europeans ages ago. Without a civilization, a nation is rendered non-functional as it no longer has the capacity to function as a unit. Scattered within a new overarching civilization, common identity becomes largely ceremonial as all aspects of life are engaged with on an individual basis or only within the family unit. This constitutes a ceremonial nation. Ceremonial Nations Ceremonial nations are an example of what I call ceremonial kinship. Ceremonial kinship is the sort of kinship where relatives don't have any real familial interactions with each other until or unless there is a specific ceremony (ex. funeral) that needs to be attended. Although this is largely harmless between family members, at the national scale it renders members of the nation highly vulnerable. Whether it is socially, economically or politically, the members of such nations do not have much power to bargain or apply force with. In this state, nations become subject to the forces that control the overarching civilization, its institutions, and economic structures. These forces can be foreign nations (Europeans and their underlings) or political parties. The consequence of this is a general loss of national sovereignty which has some of the following outcomes among many: The deterioration and eventual extinction of the language of the nation due to disuse and exclusion from business, education and most common media. The language also stops being developed and expanded both in vocabulary and phrasal power making it necessary to continuously switch to foreign languages even where one wishes to use it. Statification (becoming static) of the nation's culture, values and attire as it falls out of general use and becomes itself ceremonial - only being used on special occasions (ex. Heritage day). This static culture, especially the attire, also becomes a sort of badge of authenticity that many prefer to keep static and will even reject modernized versions of the culture, halting progress. Loss of the ability to control the nation's way of life and destiny or secure the nation from external threats (rampant crime, global pandemics, climate change, etc.) Civilization A civilization is a human society with its specific way of life that is defined by the organizational structures, familial groups, production, traditions and technology that the society has. In our current state, we are many ceremonial nations within a single European settler civilization. It (the settler civilization) is incorporated into a nation state (The Republic of South Africa) that I call \" the settler state \". I make a distinction between the land (the part of the surface of the planet that is within the borders of the state) and the country itself (the governmental structures and institutions). The way I see it, although the land may be ours the country itself is not. The country is merely a European country founded on our land. Our own unincorporated civilizations were destroyed long ago and I believe the proper course of action is to raise new civilizations to replace them. There are four main reasons why I want to create a new civilization: Post-Colonialism: I don't want to live in a post-colonial civilization; I want to live in our own civilization of just indigenous people. Dissent: Avoiding conflict with dissenters and being dragged along for their self-destructive exploits. Self-Determination: Expressing unrestrained self-determination, enabling us to control our way of life completely. Security: Gaining the ability to protect and preserve that way of life and ourselves from threats both man-made and environmental. Each reason is discussed in further detail below. Post-Colonialism The settler state is a post-colonial civilization. Specifically, I am referring to its nature and not its time of creation. All post-colonial civilizations have a common set of circumstances that I despise. Some examples are: We all speak foreign languages and all manner of foreigners expect us to accommodate them that way when they move here. Our land now contains a wild assortment of foreigners which range from the colonisers themselves, to people imported as slaves or others imported to be cheap labour. Everything from the currency, to the streets, to the cities is named after the foreigners or in a foreign language. The systems of governance are arbitrary and depend on which group of foreigners happen to colonize your land. The culture, from what constitutes formal wear to how young girls in schools can wear their hair, is dictated by foreigners. I do not wish to be a part of such a civilization. I insist on being a part of a civilization created by indigenous people that only has features of our own choosing. Dissent Currently, we are many people groups where different subsections of the populations have their own dissenting opinions about what needs to happen next. The majority of people engage with this circumstance through electoralism: Creating political parties. Joining or supporting political parties. Running for public office. Attending discussions and voting. Through this they strive to gain some amount of control of the common power structures of the settler state and use it to affect their will on all of us . Because we all want to have our way; cannot agree on a singular fate; and are all forced to share the same power structures, this creates unavoidable and insurmountable conflict. Thus, I believe the only way forward is to create a system of voluntary association through which those of us that see eye-to-eye can move forward together and avoid conflict with everyone else. Self-Determination Without the requirement of having to gain everyone's approval and support, any feature or goal that our group wants to manifest can be pursued immediately without all of the political power struggles that slow down progress. We would be in the position to: Speak and develop whatever language we want, within our own economy and work places. Create our own towns situated and organized wherever and whichever way we want. Have our own security apparatus and insulate ourselves from the insecurity of the rest of the country (insecurity that we otherwise do not have the capacity to do anything about). Institute the protectionist measures that it takes to raise one's economic might in an already established regional and global economy (ex. Not allowing outside competition for businesses in our town or city while also exploiting the labour of outsiders that are not entitled to the same benefits as members of the nation). Centrally plan and fund valuable or otherwise desired industries. These are just a number of examples but the ultimate point is the following: we already have the power to create a way of life that suits us but the need to wrestle for and rend common power structures out of the hands of competitors creates a needless and perpetual barrier towards progress. Security We exist in an unsafe and unstable country. Even to the most determined and confident individualist, this is not a circumstance that can be properly managed on an individual basis. Furthermore, without creating proper power structures and living in the same place, management of the problem remains very impractical. Without proper security, any other pursuit is pervaded by the following features: Anxiety: the reality that danger lays around every corner precludes peace of mind and thus proper gainful living. Uncertainty: the knowledge that your life can be interrupted at any moment by personal assaults (battery, hijacking, home invasion, etc.) or societal strife (economic collapse, uncontrolled plagues, Islamic militants, etc.) makes one reluctant to invest long term in anything substantial and immovable. Conflict: regular rioting and the associated property destruction make calm, quiet and peaceful modern living impossible. Turtling: managing security as an individual means implementing cumbersome security measures like electrified fencing, moving to gated communities or signing up with a private security company. Proposal For the above outlined reasons, I have resolved to found a new functional nation and the associated civilization. This will allow me and members of my nation to carve out a stable and productive way of life of our choosing - something that I do not believe can be done otherwise. If what has been discussed up to this point is appealing to you, then you may very well be a like-minded individual who would do well to join me in my endeavour. The final part of this discussion is a preliminary description of what must occur moving forward. This is intended to aid you in making up your mind by providing a clearer, though incomplete, picture of what you are signing up for should you choose to join. Consolidation At the moment, we are separate individuals, of different nations, who are scattered across a larger civilizations territory. To become a functional nation, we will have to undergo a process of consolidation. The process will involve: Setting up our governance structures. Investing in \"state-owned or public\" enterprise to generate revenue. Creating a settlement and ultimately all moving there. Creating a singular identity through deliberate cultural and language reform. All stages of consolidation will run concurrently and progress at whatever rate is accommodated by the available monetary and human capital. Governance Structures The first step is to create governance structures for the nation. These structures in time will be improved and expanded to be the governance structures of our civilization. These institutions will need to be funded with a combination of member dues and jointly owned enterprise. As we will all be paying tax to the settler state and our own government, it will be necessary for the civilization to rely primarily on revenue from public enterprise in the long term. With that said, it will still be necessary for all members to make some monetary contribution, whether it is a fixed contribution or a tax on income. This public revenue will be used for: Financing operation of the government. Investment in public enterprise. Purchasing land to start our town where our civilization will be based. Developing our town and civilization. Government services when settlement is achieved. Settlement When the government has raised enough capital, we will purchase land and begin development of a town. Because of the cost associated with land acquisition and the subsequent development of a town, this step will only begin once sufficient capital has been raised. In the meantime, members will be free to remain wherever suits them. However, once the town is habitable, all members will be expected to take up residence there. In time, this expectation will become a requirement. The residence phase will be done in a structured manner whereby members will be migrated at a reasonable pace while making consideration of the supply of amenities, work opportunities, residential and business space. Cultural and Language Reform Reforms will have to be made to reach a unified and singular identity. This will require establishing cultural institutions and going about the work of fusing both culture and language. The exact process is yet to be determined, but with a body of reasonable leaders at the helm of the relevant institutions, I believe we will be able to perform the necessary reforms. Language reform in particular is very important given the inherit value of language. The new language will become the language of our nation and civilization. Upon its completion, all members will be required to learn and use it proficiently. Through subsequent usage and development in every domain, it will become refined enough to be used as the primary language in all realms of our society. The language will be formed through the structured merging of the pre-existing languages and the design of a new alphabet (that will not be based on the Latin alphabet).","title":"Proposal"},{"location":"proposal/#nation-and-civilization","text":"","title":"Nation and Civilization"},{"location":"proposal/#abstract","text":"I propose the creation of a new functional nation and the corresponding civilization in order to replace our extinct civilizations and extant but non-functional nations.","title":"Abstract"},{"location":"proposal/#introduction","text":"Humans organize themselves into groups in order to enhance group and individual fitness.
