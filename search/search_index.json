These forces can be foreign nations (Europeans and their underlings) or political parties. The consequence of this is a general loss of national sovereignty which has some of the following outcomes among many:</p> <ul> <li>The deterioration and eventual extinction of the language of the nation due to disuse and exclusion from business, education and most common media. The language also stops being developed and expanded both in vocabulary and phrasal power making it necessary to continuously switch to foreign languages even where one wishes to use it.</li> <li>Statification (becoming static) of the nation's culture, values and attire as it falls out of general use and becomes itself ceremonial - only being used on special occasions (ex. Heritage day). This static culture, especially the attire, also becomes a sort of badge of authenticity that many prefer to keep static and will even reject modernized versions of the culture, halting progress.</li> <li>Loss of the ability to control the nation's way of life and destiny or secure the nation from external threats (rampant crime, global pandemics, climate change, etc.)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"proposal/#civilization","title":"Civilization","text":"<p>A civilization is a human society with its specific way of life that is defined by the organizational structures, familial groups, production, traditions and technology that the society has.</p> <p>In our current state, we are many ceremonial nations within a single European settler civilization.
